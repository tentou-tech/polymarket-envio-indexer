## Polymarket Indexer

_Please check the [documentation website](https://docs.envio.dev) for a complete guide on all [Envio](https://envio.dev) indexer features._

**This indexer is still a work in progress. Do not use it in production. It is meant only as a reference.**

This indexer is built to index events emitted from contracts related to Polymarket. It is created by taking reference from the [Polymarket Subgraph repo](https://github.com/Polymarket/polymarket-subgraph).

### Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

```

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js (v18 or newer)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
- [pnpm (v8 or newer)](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Subgraphs Migration Status

- [x] Wallet Subgraph
- [x] Sports Oracle Subgraph
- [x] Order Book Subgraph
- [x] OI Subgraph 
- [x] FPMM Subgraph 
- [ ] Activity Subgraph (work in progress)
- [ ] PNL Subgraph

## Tasks

- [ ] Migrate all subgraphs (work in progress)
- [ ] Validate data against the Polymarket indexer

### Smaller Tasks

- [ ] Effects for fetching details about Collateral Token
- [ ] Remove hardcoded return value from `getCollateralScale` in FPMM handler
- [ ] Debug `TradeType` import in `updatedFields.ts`
- [ ] `getPositionId` implementation (file: `ConditionalTokens.ts`)

## Notes

This indexer is a work in progress, and some parts of the logic are still being migrated. Data validation has been done for a few subgraphs so far, and we’ll be expanding correctness checks after the main migration is finished.

- The `polymarket-subgraph` repo tracks `ConditionalTokens` event multiple times which different event handlers but in our case we have merged all those event handlers into one.
